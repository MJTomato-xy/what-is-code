        <h2>Documents about "user stories"</h2>
        <p>After a few months the budget is freed up, and the Web re-architecture
          project is under way. They give it a name: Project Excelsior. Fine. TMitTB
          (who, to be fair, has other clothes and often dresses like he’s in Weezer)
          checks in with you every week.</p>
        <p>He brings documents. Every document has its own name. The functional
          specification is a set of at least a thousand statements about users clicking
          buttons. "Upon accessing the Web page the user if logged in will be identified
          by name and welcomed and if not logged in will be encouraged to log in or
          create an account. (See user registration workflow.)"</p>
        <p>God have mercy on our souls. From there it lists various error messages. It's a
          sort of blueprint in that it describes—in words, with occasional diagrams—a
          program that doesn't exist.</p>
        <p>Some parts of the functional specification refer to "user stories," tiny
          hypothetical narratives about people using the site, e.g., "As a visitor to the
          website, I want to search for products so I can quickly purchase what I want."</p>
        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>Then there's something TMitTB calls wireframe mock-ups, which are
          pictures of how the website will look, created in a program that makes
          everything seem as if it were sketched by hand, all a little squiggly—even
          though it was produced on a computer. This is so no one gets the wrong idea
          about these ideas-in-progress and takes them too seriously. Patronizing, but
          point taken.</p>
        <h2>Panel-speaking</h2>
        <p>You rarely see TMitTB in person, because he's often at conferences where he
          presents on panels. He then tweets about the panels and notes them on his
          well-populated LinkedIn page. Often he takes a picture of the audience from
          the stage, and what you see is an assembly of mostly men, many with beards,
          the majority of whom seem to be peering into their laptop instead of up at
          the stage. Nonetheless the tweet that accompanies that photo says
          something like, "AMAZING audience! @ the panel on #microservice
          architecture at #ArchiCon2015."</p>
        <p>He often tells you just how important this panel-speaking is for purposes of
          recruiting. Who's to say he is wrong? It costs as much to hire a senior
          programmer as it does to hire a midlevel executive, so maybe going to
          conferences is his job, and in the two months he's been here he's hired four
          people. His two most recent hires have been in Boston and Hungary, neither
          of which is a place where you have an office.</p>
        <p>But what does it matter? Every day he does a 15-minute "standup" meeting
          via something called Slack, which is essentially like Google Chat but with
          some sort of plaid visual theme, and the programmers seem to agree that this
          is a wonderful and fruitful way to work.</p>
        <p>"I watch the commits," TMitTB says. Meaning that every day he reviews the
          code that his team writes to make sure that it's well-organized. "No one is
          pushing to production without the tests passing. We're good."</p>
        <p>Your meetings, by comparison, go for hours, with people arranged around a
          table—sitting down. You wonder how he gets his programmers to stand up,
          but then some of them already use standing desks. Perhaps that's the ticket.
          Honestly, you would like to go to conferences sometimes and be on panels.
          You could drink bottled water and hold forth just fine.</p>
