        <h2>Tech Conferences & Identity</h2>
        <p>Conferences! The website Lanyrd lists hundreds of technology conferences
          for June 2015. There's an event for software testers in Chicago, a Twitter
          conference in São Paulo, and one on enterprise content management in
          Amsterdam. In New York alone there's the Big Apple Scrum Day, the
          Razorfish Tech Summit, an entrepreneurship boot camp for veterans, a
          conference dedicated to digital mapping, many conferences for digital
          marketers, one dedicated to Node.js, one for Ruby, and one for Scala (these
          are programming languages), a couple of breakfasts, a conference for
          cascading style sheets, one for text analytics, and something called the
          Employee Engagement Awards.</p>
        <p>Tech conferences look like you'd expect. Tons of people at a Sheraton,
          keynote in Ballroom D. Or enormous streams of people wandering through
          South by Southwest in Austin. People come together in the dozens or
          thousands and attend panels, ostensibly to learn; they attend presentations
          and brush up their skills, but there's a secondary conference function, one of
          acculturation. You go to a technology conference to affirm your tribal
          identity, to transfer out of the throng of dilettantes and into the zone of the
          professional. You pick up swag and talk to vendors, if that's your thing.</p>
          <h2>Hierarchy & Power Behind It</h2>
        <p>Technology conferences are where primate dynamics can be fully displayed,
          where relationships of power and hierarchy can be established. There are
          keynote speakers—often the people who created the technology at hand or
          crafted a given language. There are the regular speakers, often paid not at all
          or in airfare, who present some idea or technique or approach. Then there
          are the panels, where a group of people are lined up in a row and forced into
          some semblance of interaction while the audience checks its e-mail.</p>
        <p>I'm a little down on panels. They tend to drift. I'm not sure why they exist.</p>
        <h2>Unfair Treatment Towards Women in Conferences</h2>
        <p>Here's the other thing about technology conferences: There has been much
          sexual harassment and much sexist content in conferences. Which is stupid,
          because computers are dumb rocks lacking genitalia, but there you have it.</p>
        <p>Women in software, having had enough, started to write it up, post to blogs.
          Other women did the same. The problem is pervasive: There are a lot of
          conferences, and there have been many reports of harassing behavior. The
          language Ruby, the preferred language for startup bros, developed the worst
          reputation. At a Ruby conference in 2009, someone gave a talk subtitled
          "Perform Like a Pr0n Star," with sexy slides. That was dispiriting. There have
          been criminal incidents, too.</p>
        <p>Conferences began to develop codes of conduct, rules and algorithms for
          people (men, really) to follow.</p>
        <p><i>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any
          other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as
          possible …<br>

          (GeekyNerds) regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability,
          physical appearance, body size, race, religion, financial status, hair
          color (or hair amount), platform preference, or text editor of choice.<br>

        <p>When people started talking about conference behavior, they also began to
          talk about the larger problems of programming culture. This was always an
          issue, but the conference issues gave people a point of common reference.
          Why were there so many men in this field? Why do they behave so strangely?
          Why is it so hard for them to be in groups with female programmers and
          behave in a typical, adult way?</p>
        <p><i>"I go to work and I stick out like a sore thumb. I have been mistaken for an
          administrative assistant more than once. I have been asked if I was physical
          security (despite security wearing very distinctive uniforms)," wrote Erica
          Joy Baker on Medium.com who has worked, among other places, at Google.</i></p>
        <p><i>“Always the only woman in the meeting, often the first—the first female
          R&D engineer, first female project lead, first female software team lead
          —in the companies I worked for,” wrote another woman in Fast
          Company magazine.</i></p>
          <img src="5.JPG" alt="women statistics" style="width:500px;height:100px;">
        <p>Fewer than a fifth of undergraduate degrees in computer science
          awarded in 2012 went to women, according to the National Center for
          Women & Information Technology. Less than 30 percent of the people
          in computing are women. And the number of women in computing has
          fallen since the 1980s, even as the market for their skills has expanded.
          The pipeline is a huge problem. And yet it's not unsolvable. I've met
          managers who have built perfectly functional large teams that are more
          than half female coders. Places such as the handicrafts e-commerce site
          Etsy have made a particular effort to develop educational programs and
          mentorship programs. Organizations such as the not-for-profit Girl
          Develop It teach women, and just women, how to create software.</p>
        <p>It's all happening very late in the boom, though. In 2014 some
          companies began to release diversity reports for their programming
          teams. It wasn't a popular practice, but it was revealing. Intel is 23
          percent female; Yahoo! is 37 percent. Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter,
          and Microsoft are all around 30 percent. These numbers are for the
          whole companies, not only programmers. That's a lot of women who didn't get stock options. 
          The numbers of people who aren't white or
          Asian are worse yet. Apple just gave $50 million to fund diversity
          initiatives, equivalent to 0.007 percent of its market cap. Intel has a
          $300 million diversity project.</p>
        <p>The average programmer is moderately diligent, capable of basic
          mathematics, has a working knowledge of one or more programming
          languages, and can communicate what he or she is doing to
          management and his or her peers. Given that a significant number of
          women work as journalists and editors, perform surgery, run companies,
          manage small businesses, and use spreadsheets, that a few even serve on the
          Supreme Court, and that we are no longer surprised to find women working
          as accountants, professors, statisticians, or project managers, it's hard to
          imagine that they can't write JavaScript. Programming, despite the hype and
          the self-serving fantasies of programmers the world over, isn't the most
          intellectually demanding task imaginable.</p>
        <p>Which leads one to the inescapable conclusion: The problem with women in
          technology isn't the women.

      <p class="response1">Apprently, tech conference is a place for programmers to 
        communicate and brush up their skills. However, another purpose for programmers
        is to enter into the professional social circle and affirm their identity as a "professional".</p>

      <p class="response1">Technology conference is a man-dominant field.<br></br>
      Sexual harassment of women and sexist content is not rare in conferences</p>
      <br></br><br></br><br></br><br>
      <p class="response1">The numbers of female coders are lesser than males no matter in
        terms of undergraduate degrees, company teams, indicating female gets fewer opportunities in both education and 
        in the workplace.</p>
      <br></br><br></br><br></br><br>
      <p class="response1">Since women are capable of doing many jobs, they also can write code as men do. It's not the women's fault.</p>
