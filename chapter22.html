       <h2>Hardware business in the past</h2>
            Hardware is a tricky business. For decades the work of integrating, building,
            and shipping computers was a way to build fortunes. But margins tightened.
            Look at Dell, now back in private hands, or Gateway, acquired by Acer. Dell
            and Gateway, two world-beating companies, stayed out of software, typically
            building PCs that came preinstalled with Microsoft Windows—plus various
            subscription-based services to increase profits.<br></br>
            This led to much cursing from individuals who'd spent $1,000 or more on a
            computer and now had to figure out how to stop the antivirus software from
            nagging them to pay up.
            <p class="response1">Hardware products used to dominant the market.The profit margin
                was tight so companies increased the profit by subscription-based services. However, users didn't 
                like it.</p>
            <p>Years ago, when Microsoft was king, Steve Ballmer, sweating
                through his blue button-down, jumped up and down in front of a
                stadium full of people and chanted, <strong><em>"Developers! Developers!
                    Developers! Developers!"</em></strong><br>He yelled until he was hoarse: "I love this company!" Of course
                he did. If you can sell the software, if you can light up the screen,
                you're selling infinitely reproducible nothings. The margins on
                nothing are great—until other people start selling even cheaper
                nothings or giving them away. Which is what happened, as free software-
                based systems such as Linux began to nibble, then devour, the server market,
                and free-to-use Web-based applications such as Google Apps began to serve
                as viable replacements for desktop software.</p>
            <p class="response1">Free softwares!</p>
            <h2>Expectations and sales strategy has changed</h2>
                Expectations around software have changed over time. IBM unbundled
                software from hardware in the 1960s and got to charge more; Microsoft
                rebundled Internet Explorer with Windows in 1998 and got sued; Apple
                initially refused anyone else the ability to write software for the iPhone when
                it came out in 2007, and then opened the App Store, which expanded into a
                vast commercial territory—and soon the world had Angry Birds. Today,
                much hardware comes with some software—a PC comes with an operating
                system, for example, and that OS includes hundreds of subprograms, from
                mail apps to solitaire. Then you download or buy more.<br></br>
                There have been countless attempts to make software easier to write,
                promising that you could code in plain English, or manipulate a set of icons,
                or make a list of rules—software development so simple that a bright senior
                executive or an average child could do it. Decades of efforts have gone into
                helping civilians write code as they might use a calculator or write an e-mail.
                Nothing yet has done away with <em>developers, developers, developers,
                developers.</em><br>
            <p class="response1">Software has better margins than hardware because it costs nearly nothing to reproduce. 
                Software and hardware used to be unbundled, but currently hardware comes with some software though not necessarily an ideal amount. </p>
                <h2>Why are developers so important?</h2>
                Thus a craft, and a professional class that lives that craft, emerged.
                Beginning in the 1950s, but catching fire in the 1980s, a proportionally small
                number of people became adept at inventing ways to satisfy basic human
                desires (know the time, schedule a flight, send a letter, kill a zombie) by
                controlling the machine. Coders, starting with concepts such as "signals
                from a keyboard" and "numbers in memory,"" created infinitely reproducible
                units of digital execution that we call software, hoping to meet the needs of
                the marketplace. Man, did they. The systems they built are used to manage
                the global economic infrastructure. If coders don't run the world, they
                run the things that run the world.<br></br>
                Most programmers aren't working on building a widely recognized
                application like Microsoft Word. Software is everywhere. It's gone from a
                craft of fragile, built-from-scratch custom projects to an industry of
                standardized parts, where coders absorb and improve upon the labors of
                their forebears (even if those forebears are one cubicle over). Software is
                there when you switch channels and your cable box shows you what else is
                on. You get money from an ATM—software. An elevator takes you up five
                stories—the same. Facebook releases software every day to something like a
                billion people, and that software runs inside Web browsers and mobile
                applications. Facebook looks like it’s just pictures of your mom’s crocuses or
                your son's school play—but no, it's software.
                <p class="response1">Software starts as code, which is hard to write. Only those who know programming languages can write the code. Or maybe if developers figured out a way to code in plain language, their professionalism will be questioned. 
                    Software's everywhere.</p>
